# RSAP-Analysis
RSAP Minimum Categories and Assets represented as vector point, line, or polygon GIS data were analyzed for their exposure to future SLR, Storm surge, and GW flooding using ArcPy scripts and ESRIâ€™s ArcGIS Pro Version 3.2. The primary geoprocessing tools used in the analysis were the Intersect and Spatial Join functions in an ArcPy scripting model.
